## Game of Thrones

***Game of Thrones*** is an American [fantasy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fantasy_television "Fantasy television") [drama](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drama_(film_and_television) "Drama (film and television)") television series created by [David Benioff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Benioff "David Benioff") and [D.
